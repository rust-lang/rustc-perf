# 2025-09-15 Triage Log

Difficult week to interpret, because a positive change in [#145910](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/145910) skewes the results more negative in our benchmarks. Overall result is probably still slightly negative, because there's more work from added features. On the other hand, we also have a nice improvement in reducing the number of query dependencies in compiler's incremental system in [#145186](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/145186).

`tt-muncher`, `ucd` and `tuple-stress` all look like noise to me. The rest is in new-solver, which is still WIP and not enabled by default.

Seems to be caused by https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/146297, pinged the author and continuing the discussion there.

Already triaged by reviewer. Justified in PR description. Should be an improvement overall, but causes a lot of CGU perturbation in our benchmark suite.

Tiny changes mostly in artificial stress tests, overall slightly positive. Probably not worth more investigation.

Some small regressions. I suspect the primary regressions in `unicode-normalization` come from https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/144765, because it contains a few giant tables with a lot of range patterns. The other candidate would be https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/146178 but I don't see anything that would be related in that benchmark.

Either way, together with the secondary benchmarks, all of those are tiny changes (0.002s) on tiny benchmarks, so I don't think this is worth more investigation.

Slight regression in doc benchmarks, similar to [pre-merge results](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/144847#issuecomment-3189779391). Expected because of more const handling (looks like more time is spent in const related queries from brief look at the detailed results of hellp-world: https://perf.rust-lang.org/detailed-query.html?commit=5c11fb842afc9876e985886c30292a227caee632&benchmark=helloworld-doc&scenario=full&base_commit=a171994070dc18c3a32fc1aa2d98cf03ae96b63e)

Justified by https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/144847#issuecomment-3193410781, if I understand correctly.
