0.9.0 (TBD)
===========
This is a new minor version release of ripgrep that mostly contains bug fixes.

Releases provided on Github for `x86` and `x86_64` will now work on all target
CPUs, and will also automatically take advantage of features found on modern
CPUs (such as AVX2) for additional optimizations.

**BREAKING CHANGES**:

* When `--count` and `--only-matching` are provided simultaneously, the
  behavior of ripgrep is as if the `--count-matches` flag was given. That is,
  the total number of matches is reported, where there may be multiple matches
  per line. Previously, the behavior of ripgrep was to report the total number
  of matching lines. (Note that this behavior diverges from the behavior of
  GNU grep.)
* Octal syntax is no longer supported. ripgrep previously accepted expressions
  like `\1` as syntax for matching `U+0001`, but ripgrep will now report an
  error instead.
* The `--line-number-width` flag has been removed. Its functionality was not
  carefully considered with all ripgrep output formats.
  See [#795](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/795) for more
  details.

Feature enhancements:

* [FEATURE #411](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/411):
  Add a `--stats` flag, which emits aggregate statistics after search results.
* [FEATURE #646](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/646):
  Add a `--no-ignore-messages` flag, which suppresses parse errors from reading
  `.ignore` and `.gitignore` files.

  Support `\u{..}` Unicode escape sequences.
* [FEATURE #812](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/812):
  Add `-b/--byte-offset` flag that reports byte offset of each matching line.
* [FEATURE #814](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/814):
  Add `--count-matches` flag, which is like `--count`, but for each match.
* [FEATURE #880](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/880):
  Add a `--no-column` flag, which disables column numbers in the output.

0.8.0 (2018-02-11)
==================
This is a new minor version releae of ripgrep that satisfies several popular
feature requests (config files, search compressed files, true colors), fixes
many bugs and improves the quality of life for ripgrep maintainers. This
release also includes greatly improved documentation in the form of a
[User Guide](GUIDE.md) and a [FAQ](FAQ.md).

This release increases the **minimum supported Rust version** from 1.17 to
1.20.

**BREAKING CHANGES**:

Note that these are all very minor and unlikely to impact most users.

* In order to support configuration files, flag overrides needed to be
  rethought. In some cases, this changed ripgrep's behavior. For example,
  in ripgrep 0.7.1, `rg foo -s -i` will perform a case sensitive search
  since the `-s/--case-sensitive` flag was defined to always take precedence
  over the `-i/--ignore-case` flag, regardless of position. In ripgrep 0.8.0
  however, the override rule for all flags has changed to "the most recent
  flag wins among competing flags." That is, `rg foo -s -i` now performs a
  case insensitive search.
* The `-M/--max-columns` flag was tweaked so that specifying a value of `0`
  now makes ripgrep behave as if the flag was absent. This makes it possible
  to set a default value in a configuration file and then override it. The
  previous ripgrep behavior was to suppress all matching non-empty lines.
* In all globs, `[^...]` is now equivalent to `[!...]` (indicating class
  negation). Previously, `^` had no special significance in a character class.
* For **downstream packagers**, the directory hierarchy in ripgrep's archive
  releases has changed. The root directory now only contains the executable,
  README and license. There is now a new directory called `doc` which contains
  the man page (previously in the root), a user guide (new), a FAQ (new) and
  the CHANGELOG (previously not included in release). The `complete`
  directory remains the same.

Feature enhancements:

* Added or improved file type filtering for
  Apache Avro, C++, GN, Google Closure Templates, Jupyter notebooks, man pages,
  Protocol Buffers, Smarty and Web IDL.
* [FEATURE #196](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/196):
  Support a configuration file. See
  [the new user guide](GUIDE.md#configuration-file)
  for details.
* [FEATURE #261](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/261):
  Add extended or "true" color support. Works in Windows 10!
  [See the FAQ for details.](FAQ.md#colors)
* [FEATURE #539](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/539):
  Search gzip, bzip2, lzma or xz files when given `-z/--search-zip` flag.
* [FEATURE #544](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/544):
  Add support for line number alignment via a new `--line-number-width` flag.
* [FEATURE #654](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/654):
  Support linuxbrew in ripgrep's Brew tap.
* [FEATURE #673](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/673):
  Bring back `.rgignore` files. (A higher precedent, application specific
  version of `.ignore`.)
* [FEATURE #676](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/676):
  Provide ARM binaries. **WARNING:** This will be provided on a best effort
  basis.
* [FEATURE #709](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/709):
  Suggest `-F/--fixed-strings` flag on a regex syntax error.
* [FEATURE #740](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/740):
  Add a `--passthru` flag that causes ripgrep to print every line it reads.
* [FEATURE #785](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/785):
  Overhaul documentation. Cleaned up README, added user guide and FAQ.
* [FEATURE 7f5c07](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commit/7f5c07434be92103b5bf7e216b9c7494aed2d8cb):
  Add hidden flags for convenient overrides (e.g., `--no-text`).

  Write ANSI reset code as `\x1B[0m` instead of `\x1B[m`.
* [BUG #747](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/747):
  Remove `yarn.lock` from YAML file type.
* [BUG #760](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/760):

Friends of ripgrep:

I'd like to extend my gratitude to
[@balajisivaraman](https://github.com/balajisivaraman)
for their recent hard work in a number of areas, and in particular, for
implementing the "search compressed files" feature. Their work in sketching out
a specification for that and other work has been exemplary.

Thanks
[@balajisivaraman](https://github.com/balajisivaraman)!

0.5.0 (2017-03-12)
==================
This is a new minor version release of ripgrep that includes one minor breaking
change, bug fixes and several new features including support for text encodings
other than UTF-8.

A notable accomplishment with respect to Rust is that ripgrep proper now only
contains a single `unsafe` use (for accessing the contents of a memory map).

The **breaking change** is:

* [FEATURE #380](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/380):
  Line numbers are now hidden by default when ripgrep is printing to a tty
  **and** the only thing searched is stdin.

Feature enhancements:

* Added or improved file type filtering for Ceylon, CSS, Elixir, HTML, log,
  SASS, SVG, Twig
* [FEATURE #1](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1):
  Add support for additional text encodings, including automatic detection for
  UTF-16 via BOM sniffing. Explicit text encoding support with the
  `-E/--encoding` flag was also added for latin-1, GBK, EUC-JP
  and Shift_JIS, among others. The full list can be found here:
  https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-encoding-get
* [FEATURE #129](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/129):
  Add a new `-M/--max-columns` flag that omits lines longer than the given
  number of bytes. (Disabled by default!)
* [FEATURE #369](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/369):
  A new flag, `--max-filesize`, was added for limiting searches to files with
  a maximum file size.

Bug fixes:

* [BUG #52](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/52),
  [BUG #311](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/311):
  Tweak how binary files are detected and handled. (We are slightly less
  conservative and will no longer use memory without bound.)
* [BUG #326](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/326):
  When --files flag is given, we should never attempt to parse positional
  arguments as regexes.
* [BUG #327](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/327):
  Permit the --heading flag to override the --no-heading flag.
* [BUG #340](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/340):
  Clarify that the `-u/--unrestricted` flags are aliases.
* [BUG #343](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/343):
  Global git ignore config should use `$HOME/.config/git/ignore` and not
  `$HOME/git/ignore`.
* [BUG #345](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/345):
  Clarify docs for `-g/--glob` flag.
* [BUG #381](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/381):
  Add license files to each sub-crate.
* [BUG #383](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/383):
  Use latest version of clap (for argv parsing).
* [BUG #392](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/391):
  Fix translation of set globs (e.g., `{foo,bar,quux}`) to regexes.
* [BUG #401](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/401):
  Add PowerShell completion file to Windows release.
* [BUG #405](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/405):
  Fix bug when excluding absolute paths with the `-g/--glob` flag.


0.4.0
=====
This is a new minor version release of ripgrep that includes a couple very
minor breaking changes, a few new features and lots of bug fixes.

This version of ripgrep upgrades its `regex` dependency from `0.1` to `0.2`,
which includes a few minor syntax changes:

* POSIX character classes now require double bracketing. Previously, the regex
  `[:upper:]` would parse as the `upper` POSIX character class. Now it parses
  as the character class containing the characters `:upper:`. The fix to this
  change is to use `[[:upper:]]` instead. Note that variants like
  `[[:upper:][:blank:]]` continue to work.
* The character `[` must always be escaped inside a character class.
* The characters `&`, `-` and `~` must be escaped if any one of them are
  repeated consecutively. For example, `[&]`, `[\&]`, `[\&\&]`, `[&-&]` are all
  equivalent while `[&&]` is illegal. (The motivation for this and the prior
  change is to provide a backwards compatible path for adding character class
  set notation.)

Feature enhancements:

* Added or improved file type filtering for Crystal, Kotlin, Perl, PowerShell,
  Ruby, Swig
* [FEATURE #83](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/83):
  Type definitions can now include other type definitions.
* [FEATURE #243](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/243):
  **BREAKING CHANGE**: The `--column` flag now implies `--line-number`.
* [FEATURE #263](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/263):
  Add a new `--sort-files` flag.
* [FEATURE #275](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/275):
  Add a new `--path-separator` flag. Useful in cygwin.

Bug fixes:

* [BUG #182](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/182):
  Redux: use more portable ANSI color escape sequences when possible.
* [BUG #258](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/258):

0.3.1
=====
Bug fixes:

* [BUG #242](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/242):
  ripgrep didn't respect `--colors foo:none` correctly. Now it does.


0.3.0
=====
This is a new minor version release of ripgrep that includes two breaking
changes with lots of bug fixes and some new features and performance
improvements. Notably, if you had a problem with colors or piping on Windows
before, then that should now be fixed in this release.

**BREAKING CHANGES**:

* ripgrep now requires Rust 1.11 to compile. Previously, it could build on
  Rust 1.9. The cause of this was the move from
  [Docopt to Clap](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/233)
  for argument parsing.
* The `-e/--regexp` flag can no longer accept a pattern starting with a `-`.
  There are two work-arounds: `rg -- -foo` and `rg [-]foo` or `rg -e [-]foo`
  will all search for the same `-foo` pattern. The cause of this was the move
  from [Docopt to Clap](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/233)
  for argument parsing.
  [This may get fixed in the
  future.](https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-rs/issues/742).

Performance improvements:

* [PERF #33](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/33):
  ripgrep now performs similar to GNU grep on small corpora.
* [PERF #136](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/136):
  ripgrep no longer slows down because of argument parsing when given a large
  argument list.

Feature enhancements:

* Added or improved file type filtering for Elixir.
* [FEATURE #7](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/7):
  Add a `-f/--file` flag that causes ripgrep to read patterns from a file.
* [FEATURE #51](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/51):
  Add a `--colors` flag that enables one to customize the colors used in
  ripgrep's output.
* [FEATURE #138](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/138):
  Add a `--files-without-match` flag that shows only file paths that contain
  zero matches.
* [FEATURE #230](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/230):
  Add completion files to the release (Bash, Fish and PowerShell).

Bug fixes:

* [BUG #37](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/37):
  Use correct ANSI escape sequences when `TERM=screen.linux`.
* [BUG #94](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/94):
  ripgrep now detects stdin on Windows automatically.
* [BUG #117](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/117):
  Colors should now work correctly and automatically inside mintty.
* [BUG #182](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/182):
  Colors should now work within Emacs. In particular, `--color=always` will
  emit colors regardless of the current environment.
* [BUG #189](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/189):
  Show less content when running `rg -h`. The full help content can be
  accessed with `rg --help`.
* [BUG #210](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/210):
  Support non-UTF-8 file names on Unix platforms.
* [BUG #231](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/231):
  Switch from block buffering to line buffering.
* [BUG #241](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/241):
  Some error messages weren't suppressed when `--no-messages` was used.


0.2.9
=====
Bug fixes:

* [BUG #226](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/226):
  File paths explicitly given on the command line weren't searched in parallel.
  (This was a regression in `0.2.7`.)
* [BUG #228](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/228):
  If a directory was given to `--ignore-file`, ripgrep's memory usage would
  grow without bound.


0.2.8
=====
Bug fixes:

* Fixed a bug with the SIMD/AVX features for using bytecount in commit
  `4ca15a`.


0.2.7
=====
Performance improvements:

* [PERF #223](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/223):
  Added a parallel recursive directory iterator. This results in major
  performance improvements on large repositories.
* [PERF #11](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/11):
  ripgrep now uses the `bytecount` library for counting new lines. In some
  cases, ripgrep runs twice as fast. Use
  `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo build --release --features 'simd-accel avx-accel'`
  to get the fastest possible binary.

Feature enhancements:

* Added or improved file type filtering for Agda, Tex, Taskpaper, Markdown,
  asciidoc, textile, rdoc, org, creole, wiki, pod, C#, PDF, C, C++.
* [FEATURE #149](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/149):
  Add a new `--no-messages` flag that suppresses error messages.
  Note that `rg foo 2> /dev/null` also works.
* [FEATURE #159](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/159):
  Add a new `-m/--max-count` flag that limits the total number of matches
  printed for each file searched.

Bug fixes:

* [BUG #199](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/199):
  Fixed a bug where `-S/--smart-case` wasn't being applied correctly to
  literal optimizations.
* [BUG #203](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/203):
  Mention the full name, ripgrep, in more places. It now appears in
  the output of `--help` and `--version`. The repository URL is now also
  in the output of `--help` and the man page.
* [BUG #215](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/215):
  Include small note about how to search for a pattern that starts with a `-`.


0.2.6
=====
Feature enhancements:

* Added or improved file type filtering for Fish.

Bug fixes:

* [BUG #206](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/206):

  [`ignore`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/tree/master/ignore)
  crate that encapsulates all of ripgrep's gitignore matching logic.

Bug fixes:

* [BUG #44](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/44):
  ripgrep runs slowly when given lots of positional arguments that are
  directories.
* [BUG #119](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/119):
  ripgrep didn't reset terminal colors if it was interrupted by `^C`.
  Fixed in [PR #187](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/187).
