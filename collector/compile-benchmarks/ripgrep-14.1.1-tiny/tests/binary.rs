// This file contains a smattering of tests specifically for checking ripgrep's
// handling of binary files. There's quite a bit of discussion on this in this
// bug report: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/306

// Our haystack is the first 500 lines of Gutenberg's copy of "A Study in
// Scarlet," with a NUL byte at line 1898: `abcdef\x00`.
//
// The position and size of the haystack is, unfortunately, significant. In
// particular, the NUL byte is specifically inserted at some point *after* the
// first 65,536 bytes, which corresponds to the initial capacity of the buffer
// that ripgrep uses to read files. (grep for DEFAULT_BUFFER_CAPACITY.) The
// position of the NUL byte ensures that we can execute some search on the
// initial buffer contents without ever detecting any binary data. Moreover,
// when using a memory map for searching, only the first 65,536 bytes are
// scanned for a NUL byte, so no binary bytes are detected at all when using
// a memory map (unless our query matches line 1898).
//
// One last note: in the tests below, we use --no-mmap heavily because binary
// detection with memory maps is a bit different. Namely, NUL bytes are only
// searched for in the first few KB of the file and in a match. Normally, NUL
// bytes are searched for everywhere.
//
// TODO: Add tests for binary file detection when using memory maps.
const HAY: &'static [u8] = include_bytes!("./data/sherlock-nul.txt");

// This tests that ripgrep prints a warning message if it finds and prints a
// match in a binary file before detecting that it is a binary file. The point
// here is to notify that user that the search of the file is only partially
// complete.
//
// This applies to files that are *implicitly* searched via a recursive
// directory traversal. In particular, this results in a WARNING message being
// printed. We make our file "implicit" by doing a recursive search with a glob
// that matches our file.
