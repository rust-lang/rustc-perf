Hello foo!

crates.io user foo has added a new "Trusted Publishing" configuration for G=
itHub Actions to a crate that you manage (foo). Trusted publishers act as t=
rusted users and can publish new versions of the crate automatically.

Trusted Publishing configuration:

- Repository owner: rust-lang
- Repository name: foo-rs
- Workflow filename: publish.yml
- Environment: (not set)

If you did not make this change and you think it was made maliciously, you =
can remove the configuration from the crate via the "Settings" tab on the c=
rate's page.

If you are unable to revert the change and need to do so, you can email hel=
p@crates.io to communicate with the crates.io support team.
