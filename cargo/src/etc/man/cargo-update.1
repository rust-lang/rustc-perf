.SH NAME
.PP
cargo\-update \- Update the package dependencies
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[I]cargo update\f[] [OPTIONS]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Update dependencies as recorded in the local lock file.
.PP
This command requires that a \f[I]Cargo.lock\f[] already exists as
generated by \f[I]cargo build\f[] or related commands.
.PP
If \f[I]SPEC\f[] is given, then a conservative update of the
\f[I]lockfile\f[] will be performed.
This means that only the dependency specified by \f[I]SPEC\f[] will be
updated.
Its transitive dependencies will be updated only if \f[I]SPEC\f[] cannot
be updated without updating dependencies.
All other dependencies will remain locked at their currently recorded
versions.
.PP
If \f[I]PRECISE\f[] is specified, then \f[B]\-\-aggressive\f[] must not
also be specified.
The argument \f[I]PRECISE\f[] is a string representing a precise
revision that the package being updated should be updated to.
For example, if the package comes from a git repository, then
\f[I]PRECISE\f[] would be the exact revision that the repository should
be updated to.
.PP
If \f[I]SPEC\f[] is not given, then all dependencies will be
re\-resolved and updated.

pkgid".
