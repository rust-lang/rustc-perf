//! Support for nightly features in Cargo itself
//!
//! This file is the version of `feature_gate.rs` in upstream Rust for Cargo
//! itself and is intended to be the avenue for which new features in Cargo are
//! gated by default and then eventually stabilized. All known stable and
//! unstable features are tracked in this file.
//!
//! If you're reading this then you're likely interested in adding a feature to
//! Cargo, and the good news is that it shouldn't be too hard! To do this you'll
//! want to follow these steps:
//!
//! 1. Add your feature. Do this by searching for "look here" in this file and
//!    expanding the macro invocation that lists all features with your new
//!    feature.
//!
//! 2. Find the appropriate place to place the feature gate in Cargo itself. If
//!    you're extending the manifest format you'll likely just want to modify
//!    the `Manifest::feature_gate` function, but otherwise you may wish to
//!    place the feature gate elsewhere in Cargo.
//!
//! 3. To actually perform the feature gate, you'll want to have code that looks
//!    like:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use core::{Feature, Features};
//!
//! let feature = Feature::launch_into_space();
//! package.manifest().features().require(feature).chain_err(|| {
//!     "launching Cargo into space right now is unstable and may result in \
//!      unintended damage to your codebase, use with caution"
//! })?;
//! ```
//!
//! Notably you'll notice the `require` funciton called with your `Feature`, and
//! then you use `chain_err` to tack on more context for why the feature was
//! required when the feature isn't activated.
//!
//! And hopefully that's it! Bear with us though that this is, at the time of
//! this writing, a very new feature in Cargo. If the process differs from this
//! we'll be sure to update this documentation!
